# Project brief
## Background context 

The GenAI Consulting team at BCG has been approached by a leading global financial institution, Global Finance Corp. (GFC), to address a pressing challenge in their operations. GFC, amid a rapidly evolving financial landscape, is seeking to enhance its capabilities in analyzing corporate financial performance. They have identified a need for a sophisticated, AI-driven solution to stay ahead in the market and provide their clients with deeper, more accessible insights into corporate financial health.

GFC's traditional methods of financial analysis, though reliable, have become time-consuming and less efficient in the face of increasing data volumes and the fast pace of financial markets. They are looking to BCG, known for its cutting-edge AI solutions, to develop a tool that can quickly analyze and interpret large sets of financial data, specifically from 10-K and 10-Q reports.

## The project 

Your role as a junior data scientist in the GenAI Consulting team is pivotal in developing an AI-powered chatbot that can analyze and provide insights on corporate financial performance from 10-K and 10-Q financial documents.

The pressure is high, as GFC is looking to implement this solution in the upcoming financial quarter. The GenAI Consulting team is feeling a mix of excitement and urgency, understanding the impact this project could have on their reputation and future opportunities. As a junior data scientist, you are expected to bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions, working under the guidance of your manager, Aisha, to meet these high expectations.
